# 🛡️ SafeWord - Personal Safety Keyword Detection

A local prototype that detects a user-defined *safe word* and triggers protective actions (record audio, alert contacts). Built with **Mycroft Precise** for keyword spotting, **Flask** backend, and **React** frontend.

## 🎯 Features

- **Custom Wake Word Training**: Record your own safe word samples and train a personalized detection model
- **Real-time Detection**: Continuously listen for your safe word using Mycroft Precise
- **Automatic Actions**: When detected, automatically:
  - Record audio clip for evidence
  - Encrypt recordings for privacy
  - Send alerts to emergency contacts (SMS/Email - placeholder)
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly React app for training and configuration
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally on your machine

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Node.js 16+** and npm
- **Microphone** access
- **Mycroft Precise** (installation instructions below)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Mycroft Precise
pip install precise-runner

# Copy environment template (optional - for SMS/Email features)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials if needed

# Start Flask server
python app.py
```

The backend will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Open a new terminal and navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start React development server
npm start
```

The frontend will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Step 1: Record Training Samples

1. Open the React app at `http://localhost:3000`
2. In the **Record Training Samples** section:
   - Select "Wake Word (your safe word)"
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - Speak your safe word clearly
   - Repeat 10-20 times with slight variations in tone and volume
3. Optionally record some "Not Wake Word" samples (other phrases)

**Tip**: The more varied samples you provide, the better the detection accuracy.

### Step 2: Train the Model

1. In the **Train Model** section:
   - Verify you have at least 10 wake-word samples
   - Adjust training epochs if desired (10 is good for quick testing, 50+ for better accuracy)
   - Click "Start Training"
   - Wait for training to complete (may take 2-10 minutes depending on epochs)

### Step 3: Configure Actions (Optional)

1. In the **Actions Configuration** section:
   - Set recording duration (how long to record after detection)
   - Enable/disable encryption
   - Add emergency contacts (SMS/Email features are placeholders for now)
   - Set grace period if desired
   - Click "Save Configuration"

### Step 4: Start Detection

1. In the **Detection Control** section:
   - Adjust detection threshold (0.5 is a good default)
   - Click "Start Detection"
   - Speak your safe word to test
   - When detected, actions will trigger automatically

**Tip**: Use "Test Trigger" to test actions without speaking.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Mycroft Precise Not Found

**Error**: `precise-train` or `precise-listen` command not found

**Solution**: 
```bash
pip install precise-runner
# Or install from source: https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-precise
```

### PyAudio Installation Issues

**macOS**:
```bash
brew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio
```

**Ubuntu/Debian**:
```bash
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
pip install pyaudio
```

**Windows**:
```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

### Microphone Permission Denied

- **Browser**: Grant microphone permission when prompted
- **macOS**: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Microphone → Allow Terminal/Python
- **Linux**: Check PulseAudio/ALSA configuration

### Training Takes Too Long

- Reduce epochs (try 5-10 for quick testing)
- Use fewer samples (minimum 10 wake-word samples)
- Consider training on a more powerful machine

### False Detections

- Increase detection threshold (0.6-0.8)
- Record more varied wake-word samples
- Add more "not wake word" samples
- Retrain with more epochs (50-100)

### Low Detection Rate

- Decrease detection threshold (0.3-0.4)
- Ensure samples are similar to real usage (volume, tone, environment)
- Record more samples (20-30)
- Check microphone quality and positioning

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All audio processing happens on your machine
- **No Cloud**: No data is sent to external servers
- **Encryption**: Recordings can be encrypted with your key
- **Open Source**: Review and audit the code yourself

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is a prototype for educational/personal use. For production safety applications, conduct thorough testing and security audits.

## 🚧 Known Limitations & TODOs

- [ ] SMS/Email alerts are placeholders (Twilio/SMTP code commented out)
- [ ] Training blocks the main thread (should be async/background)
- [ ] No authentication/authorization (local use only)
- [ ] Limited error recovery in subprocess management
- [ ] No mobile app (web UI only)
- [ ] No background service mode (must keep terminal open)

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- **Background Mode**: Run as system service/daemon
- **Mobile Apps**: iOS/Android native apps
- **Cloud Sync**: Optional encrypted cloud backup of recordings
- **Multi-word Support**: Train multiple safe words
- **Location Sharing**: Send GPS coordinates on detection
- **Video Recording**: Optional camera recording
- **False Positive Protection**: Confirmation mechanism
- **Better Notifications**: Desktop/push notifications

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test in a safe environment before relying on this system
2. **Privacy**: Be aware of recording laws in your jurisdiction
3. **Accuracy**: No detection system is 100% accurate - use as one layer of safety
4. **Emergency Services**: This doesn't replace calling emergency services (911, etc.)
5. **Backup Power**: Consider what happens if power/internet fails
